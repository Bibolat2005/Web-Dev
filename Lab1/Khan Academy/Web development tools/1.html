Upload multi-file websites to Github
Some of you may already be working on multi-file websites outside of Khan Academy, using a 
desktop editor. Your website might have multiple HTML, CSS, JS, and image files.
If you want to upload that website to Github, don't worry, you don't need to copy and paste 
each of those files individually! That would get quite tedious indeed. There's a better way...
Open your project on Github and click "Upload files". You’ll see the Github file uploader 
interface. To select your files, drag-and-drop or use the file chooser:
Find your project folder and select the files you want to upload.
Change the commit message as desired and click “Commit changes”.-->
